🎮 G4C Game Hosting Page Assignment
Build your own game portfolio site and go live like a real dev!

🧾 Overview:
You’ve designed an awesome game—now it’s time to share it with the world using a custom web page! You'll customize a pre-made template and publish it online using GitHub Pages. This is your opportunity to showcase your creativity, design thinking, and technical skills.

✅ What to Do:
1️⃣ Clone the Project Repository
Go to this GitHub repo:
👉 https://github.com/Thomas-A-Edison-CTE-HS/G4C.git
Fork or Clone it into your own GitHub account.
Open the project in your code editor.
2️⃣ Customize Your Web Page
Open index.html and make it yours:

✍️ Replace all Lorem ipsum text with your original writing:
🎯 PITCH – What is your game about? What’s the objective? Why will players love it?
🌱 THEME – Choose one of the official G4C themes and explain how your game ties into it:
Outplay Hunger
Nurture Yourself with Nature
Peace Formers
🧠 MY WHY – Why did you create this game? What message or impact do you hope it has?
✨ Also update:
The quote/tagline at the top
Your name and role
Your avatar image or placeholder
The LinkedIn or social media link (can be fake/blank if preferred)
3️⃣ Show Off Your Game
Depending on where your game is hosted:

✅ If it's embeddable, like from Itch.io, update the <iframe> link.

⚠️ If it’s on Play.Unity.com, it won’t embed:

Record a short demo video of your game (screen capture)
Add it to your page using the included <video> element
Include a direct link to your Unity-hosted game so others can play it!
4️⃣ Go Live with GitHub Pages
Publish your customized page:

Go to your repo settings
Scroll down to GitHub Pages
Under "Source", select:
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
Click Save
Wait a few seconds for your live site URL (ex: https://yourusername.github.io/G4C/)
Test your link in a browser!
5️⃣ Submit Your Work
📤 Submit your GitHub Pages URL to the class form or LMS assignment.

🌟 Tips for Success:
Make sure your writing is clear, honest, and professional
Don’t rush! This page is your digital business card as a game dev
Check your links, video, and layout before submitting
You’re not just a game developer—you’re now a presenter and publisher too. Own it! 💻🎮✨
